      <h2>Welcome to the Black Mask Society</h2>
      <p>
        The Black Mask Society (BMS) is an elite brotherhood for those who dare to live on the edge. Designed for individuals who thrive in extreme environments, this society recognizes those who seek thrill, push their limits, and walk fearlessly into the unknown.

      <h3>What It Means to Be a Black Mask</h3>
      <p>
        To be a Black Mask is to live without fear. Members are elite athletes, thrill-seekers, and rule-breakers — from professional skaters, cliff divers, and downhill bikers to those who live for adrenaline. The Black Mask becomes a part of you — a symbol of danger, mystery, and power.

      <h3>How to Become a Black Mask</h3>
      <p>
        Entry is limited and exclusive. You must either:
        <ul>
          <li>Be recognized and invited by an existing Black Mask member</li>
          <li>Apply to the <strong>Black Mask Training Program</strong> — a brutal 14-day experience</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Black Mask Training is a two-week test of will and survival. You’ll face 7 deadly obstacles across the 14 days, each designed to push you to your breaking point. One rest day follows each challenge. Survive — and impress — and you may earn your mask. Many attempt it, few survive.
